1) StreamingT2V: A great T2V approach for video generation using text prompt, according to their research paper, they applied 23 conv layers for both encoder and decoder,
for applying hugh resolution and quality videos (long videos).

GitHub repo for clone and run the project locally (with a lot of hopes): https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/StreamingT2V
Research paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14773

2) Mora: A multimodal model for T2V generation, uses a huge architecture inside, but had an open source page on GitHub.
Maybe it will be a free-api key, or maybe the finetune will be good when the code is updated to the repo.

3) Open sora plan - an open source sora plan for generating videos bia prompts, the github repo for this demo plan:
